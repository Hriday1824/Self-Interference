# Self-Interference Cancellation in In-Band Full Duplex Communication

This repository contains the implementation of self-interference (SI) cancellation algorithms for in-band full duplex (IBFD) communication systems. The focus is on advanced non-linear cancellation techniques using:

- **Maximum Versoria Criterion (MVC) Adaptive Algorithm**
- **Neural Networks (NN)**
- **Spline Adaptive Filters (SAF)**

## üìå Project Overview

In full-duplex systems, simultaneous transmission and reception on the same frequency leads to self-interference. The goal is to cancel this strong interference using robust nonlinear adaptive filters.

### Objectives:
- Mitigate linear and nonlinear self-interference using advanced filtering methods.
- Compare performance between neural network and spline-based MVC algorithms.

## üìà Techniques Implemented

### 1. MVC Adaptive Filter
- Cancels linear SI using robust outlier-resistant filtering.
- Provides ~37.9 dB of linear SI cancellation.

### 2. MVC + Neural Network
- Deep neural network with 17 ReLU hidden layers.
- Trained using Adam optimizer.
- Handles complex nonlinear residual interference.
- Achieves ~6.46 dB of nonlinear SI cancellation.

### 3. MVC + Spline Adaptive Filter
- Combines FIR filtering with spline-based nonlinear mapping.
- Learns control points for smooth cancellation.
- Achieves ~0.66 dB of nonlinear SI cancellation.

## üî¨ Simulation Results

| Method                  | Linear SI Cancellation | Nonlinear SI Cancellation | Distance from Noise Floor |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| MVC + Neural Network   | 37.90 dB               | 6.46 dB                    | 3.70 dB                    |
| MVC + Spline Filter    | 37.89 dB               | 0.66 dB                    | 9.51 dB                    |

## üß† Key Insights

- Neural networks show superior non-linear modeling capability due to their deep structure and optimizer-based training.
- Spline filters are lightweight and smooth but less adaptive to abrupt hardware-induced nonlinearities.
